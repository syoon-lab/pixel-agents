# Pixel Agents e2e tests

Playwright end-to-end tests for the VS Code extension and the standalone `npx pixel-agents` server. This README is the single source of truth for what's e2e-tested, what's not, and how to run the suite.

## What this suite covers

Behavioral overview by area. Each area corresponds to a `test.describe` block in the spec files, an `@area:` tag on each test title, and an Allure `epic` label.

### Spawn paths (`@area:spawn`)

Agents being created and adopted. Covers internal terminals launched by clicking `+ Agent`, external Claude sessions adopted by the hook server or the JSONL scanner, basic Task subagent appearance/despawn, and lead+teammate routing for inline and tmux team modes.

### Lifecycle regressions (`@area:lifecycle`)

Edge cases that historically caused agent-character desync: `/clear`, `--resume`, X-button close, dismissal cooldown, parallel sub-agents, teammate add/remove, rapid `/clear` followed by a new tool, late resume after stale cleanup.

### Cross-cutting checks (`@area:cross-cutting`)

Invariants that should hold across every spawn path: tool status text matches the active tool name, sound chimes fire on the right events, restored agents skip the matrix spawn animation, hook installer preserves third-party hooks, settings persist across webview reload, sub-agent permission timer fires, layout editor enter/paint/save/exit smoke.

### Teams routing (`@area:teams`)

Lead and teammate tool routing in both inline and tmux team modes, internal and external.

### Hooks-off matrix (`@area:matrix`)

Every spawn permutation (internal vs external origin × basic vs inline-teammate vs tmux-teammate mode) re-verified against the heuristic JSONL-polling path with the hook server disabled. Confirms the polling-based detection produces the same agent state as the hook-driven path.

### Standalone server (`@area:standalone`)

The `npx pixel-agents` CLI path: hook-driven lifecycle propagates from the local server into the browser SPA via the single `/ws` WebSocket endpoint.

## What's NOT covered (gaps + deferred)

Scenarios that exist as product behavior but are not in the automated suite. PRs that close a gap should remove the corresponding row.

## Pre-release manual smoke (~30 min)

CI green on this suite is the safety net for behavioral regressions. The checks below are what e2e can't meaningfully assert on (visual polish, real-Claude integration, cross-process behaviors). Run them before tagging a Marketplace release — not on every PR.

**Visual + interactive polish** (after any change touching `renderer.ts`, `spriteCache.ts`, `colorize.ts`, `*.tsx`, CSS, or `editorActions.ts`):

- Pan around the office with middle-mouse drag — characters z-sort correctly against same-row chairs and lower-row desks, no flicker.
- Spawn 3+ agents — matrix spawn animation renders cleanly, characters move smoothly between seats.
- Open the Layout editor — paint floor with HSBC sliders, place + rotate (R) furniture, toggle on/off (T) state, drag-to-move in SELECT, multi-stage Esc unwinds correctly.
- Hover and click characters — overlay text positioning is correct, selection outline crisp, click on a seat reassigns.

**Real Claude Code integration** (mock-claude is a fixture; real Claude's JSONL has edge cases the mock doesn't):

- Launch the Extension Development Host (F5), click + Agent, ask Claude to do a few tool-heavy turns and a permission-requiring tool. Watch for character desync, missing animations, stuck permission bubbles.
- Use a session with a large pasted image (multi-MB base64 user message) — confirm the "Possible format issue" warning doesn't false-fire and tool tracking still works.
- Test with one MCP server installed — confirm `mcp_progress` records don't break tool status.

**`npx pixel-agents` standalone** (e2e covers Chrome via Playwright; verify other browsers + real workflow):

- `node dist/cli.js` (or `npx pixel-agents` after publish), open `http://localhost:3100` in Firefox AND Safari, run a real Claude session in a terminal — confirm characters appear and animate via WebSocket.
- Refresh the browser mid-session — WebSocketTransport reconnects, agents reappear from server state.

**Cross-window sync** (rarely covered by CI, easy to break):

- Open two VS Code windows. Edit the layout in one (paint a tile, save). Within ~2 s the other window picks it up.

**First-run experience** (before publishing):

- Delete `~/.pixel-agents/` entirely. Launch the extension fresh — default layout loads, first-run tooltip appears, no console errors, hooks auto-install on first agent spawn.

**Platform sanity** (CI hosts ≠ your machine):

- On the OS you primarily develop on, run a normal session for ~5 minutes — confirm no surprise CPU spikes, no leaked file watchers, panel reload doesn't lose state.

Skip the F5 matrix walk-through that used to take hours — the e2e suite covers it. Hand-driven testing now exists only to catch what automated assertions structurally can't see.

## Running

```bash
cd pixel-agents
npm run compile && npm run e2e               # full suite (~10 min)

npm run e2e -- --grep "@area:spawn"          # filter by area tag
npm run e2e -- --grep "@area:cross-cutting"
npm run e2e -- --headed                      # watch chromium for standalone test

npm run e2e:inventory                        # regenerate the inventory section below
npm run test:report                          # build the Allure dashboard from latest run
npm run test:report:open                     # serve + open the Allure dashboard in a browser
```

## Mocking model & rules

E2E tests drive Pixel Agents through a Claude-like **process boundary**, not by poking internals. The mocked `claude` (`e2e/fixtures/mock-claude` → `mock-claude-runner.cjs`) behaves like the real CLI for the parts Pixel Agents observes: it spawns as a process, creates its own append-only JSONL transcripts, and executes the installed hook script under `~/.pixel-agents/hooks` — the same path the real CLI uses. The builder API itself (`claudeScenario(...)`, `.at()`, `.appendJsonl()`, `.emitHook()`, `.holdOpenFor()`) is documented in CONTRIBUTING.md → "Mock claude".

Rules for a correct test:

- **Drive behavior through a scenario, not by hand.** Define timed actions with the `claudeScenario(...)` builder and let the mock perform them. Don't hand-write transcript files or hand-fire hooks inside a terminal-driven test body.
- **Transcripts are append-only.** Existing JSONL lines are never mutated in place; new records appear later in the stream. Scenarios model this with timed `.appendJsonl(...)` steps.
- **Assert only on Playwright-visible outcomes** — agent overlays, character state, sound hooks — never on the mock's internals. The mock never decides pass/fail.
- **Standalone is the one exception.** `standalone/hooks.spec.ts` has no VS Code terminal to host a mocked `claude`, so it POSTs to the server's hook endpoint directly via `sendHookEvent`. That is correct _only_ for the standalone-server path; every terminal-driven test must use the scenario builder.

## What to read before adding a test

- `pixel-agents/CLAUDE.md` — architecture and message protocol
- `pixel-agents/e2e/fixtures/pixel-agents.ts` — fixture lifecycle
- `pixel-agents/e2e/helpers/` — every helper, especially `hooks.ts`, `mock-claude.ts`, `office.ts`, `webview.ts`

When you add a new test:

- Pick a `test.describe` block that matches an existing `@area:` tag, OR add a new area to the "What this suite covers" section above and pick a tag.
- Add `@area:<tag>` to the test title.
- Add Allure `epic` / `feature` / `story` labels matching the area.
- Run `npm run e2e:inventory` and commit the regenerated section.

When you remove a test:

- Run `npm run e2e:inventory` so the inventory drops it.
- If the scenario it tested is now manual or deferred, add a row to "What's NOT covered".

## Coverage philosophy

We do not measure e2e via code coverage (too noisy, doesn't map to user-observable scenarios). Coverage is tracked by:

1. **The inventory section above** — every test in the suite with its area tag and file:line.
2. **The "What's NOT covered" gap list** — deliberately maintained; closing a gap removes the corresponding row.
3. **Allure dashboard** — `epic` / `feature` / `story` labels group tests by area without needing this file. Run `npm run test:report` after a suite run, then open `allure-report/allure/index.html` → Behaviors view.
